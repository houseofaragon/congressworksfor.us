		<h2>What does the chairperson of the DNC do?</h2>
		<h3>The <a href="http://www.demrulz.org/wp-content/files/DNC_Charter__Bylaws_9.11.2009.pdf">DNC charter</a> says the chair is "responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness" during nominating processes. The chair also heads the executive committee responsible for allocating funds and resources to state organizations.</h3>
		<h2>Who is running?</h2>
		<h3>There are currently <a href='#candidate-wrapper'>five candidates</a>.</h3>
		<h2>Does anyone get to vote for the chairperson?</h2>
		<h3>Nope! Similar to the process for nominating the Democratic candidate for president, the chairperson is chosen by a group of DNC party members and leaders (about 440 of them).</h3>
		<h2>So what can we do about it?</h2>
		<h3>Make your voice heard! Call or contact DNC members who represent your state and tell them how you want the Democratic party to be shaped in the years ahead!</h3>
